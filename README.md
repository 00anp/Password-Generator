Password security is an important issue on the internet. The functionality of this tool is totally random. It's recomended to have a lenghty password, and to have different types of criteria in it, based on users selections it will display a password generated at random.

When the user creates a password using this tool, the password is not stored anywhere on the site only on the user's device, as soon as the page is refreshed all of the created passwords will be deleted.
